# Electron Cortana, or... Cortana Electron!
A custom, local Cortana client built with Electron, inspired by the classic design and functionality of Microsoft's original assistant.

### About The Project

As a kid, my Nana got me into tech. What was one thing she let me do? Talk to Cortana. She had a whole Microphone setup for Cortana. I miss those days, and I want Cortana back.
...
So, I decided to try and work on bringing Cortana back, the way I remember.

### Features

*   **TTS Responses:** Utilizes the built-in system Text-to-Speech engine (like Windows Zira) to speak responses.
*   **Bing Web Search:** Opens a mobile-formatted Bing search in an integrated webview for general queries. (Unfinished, buggy.)
*   **Built-in Skills:**
    *   **Weather Forecast:** Ask "weather in [CITY OR ZIP CODE RIGHT HERE]" to get current conditions. (Unfinished, buggy.)
    *   **Calculator:** Type any simple math equation to get a quick answer. (An example would be: 8*8)
    *   **Time Lookup:** Ask for the time locally ("what time is it?") or in any major city ("time in Tokyo"). (Unfinished, buggy.)
    *   **Jokes:** Because every assistant needs some jokes. C'mon. (Local-only set of jokes that'll be expanded on over time.)
